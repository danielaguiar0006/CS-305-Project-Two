# CS-305-Project-Two

At Global Rain, as a developer my role was to work for Artemis Financial, a consulting firm that provides financial planning for saving, retirement, and investment, as they needed higher security for a RESTful web API supporting clients. I was tasked with analyzing the their codebase/project for any type of software vulnerabilities and correcting/fixing them. I also implemented AES-256 encryption and SHA-256 checksums for ensuring integrity. The most challenging part of completing this project was dependency management, because all/most of their dependencies including Spring Boot were severely outdated and the OWASP dependency checker found multiple critical security vulnerabilities. This project shows my skills in vulnerability detection, adding security layers, and extensive testing, which is a real value not only for security positions but also any programming/coding position as-well. Key tools and technologies included Maven, OWASP Dependency Check, and secure coding standards-skills which later on will be indispensable when creating highly secure projects.
